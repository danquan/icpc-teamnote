Given a certain lattice polygon (all its vertices have integer coordinates in some 2D grid) with non-zero area.

We denote its area by $S$, the number of points with integer coordinates lying strictly inside the polygon by $I$ and the number of points lying on polygon sides by $B$.

Then, the Pick's formula states:

\begin{center}
$S=I+ \frac{B}{2} - 1$
\end{center}
